# Computer Vision Pest Detection
A YoloV5 model for detecting and identifying insects. <br />

If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/organization-x/omni/issues).

### Purpose
Bugs and insects have been around for millions of years. They range from small things such as ticks to things as large as beetles. There are quintillions of these insects in the world, and not many people can easily separate one from another, especially within a single species. Many of these bugs have even invaded our homes, making lives harder for all of us. It is difficult to be able to solve a problem that you cannot identify. Our AI helps identify the most common pests, and can give you insight on how to get rid of them.

### Video Demo
We'll put a video demo here once we have one.

### Development Process
1. Scraping over a thousand images off of the web using [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/).
2. Labelling all of these images using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
3. Training a basic [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model.
4. Refining dataset by adding more images and improving labels using polygons <br /> ![Overly accurate polygon](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998386288908578816/1004822120221642772/Capture.PNG)
5. More training using larger models.
6. Website creation and deployment of model using Flask.
